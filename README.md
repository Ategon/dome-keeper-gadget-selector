# Dome Keeper: Gadget Selector
This is a community made mod for dome keeper that allows you to choose one of the gadgets that you would normally get in a run in the main menu. This is meant to mimic the behaviour of you being able to choose a gadget to persist into the next run to allow easy setup of things like speedruns without needing to do a dummy run first. 

# Installation 
1. Download the zip of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/Ategon/dome-keeper-gadget-selector/releases)
2. Copy the contents of the `Mod Loader` folder (`patch.gd` and `patch.pck`) into your game's installation folder (In steam you can get to it from right clicking the game in your library -> clicking properties -> clicking local files -> clicking browse
3. Set your game's launch options to include the patch file (In steam this can be done by pasting `--script patch.gd` into the launch options bar that shows up from right clicking the game in your library -> clicking properties -> clicking general and then scrolling down)
4. Copy the contents of the `Mods` folder into the game data folder (if this is your first mod youll need to make a folder named `Mods` to paste it into or just copy paste the whole folder) (In windows you can access the game data folder by starting the `Run` app, pasting `%AppData%/Godot/app_userdata/Dome Keeper/` into the bar that pops up and then hitting ok)
